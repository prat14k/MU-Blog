(33, 3, '2015-09-25', '07:59:46', '<p>For most democratic countries in the world, it is a norm to keep bureaucracy and military, apart from a host of other bodies like Election Commission, Parliamentary or Experts panels, etc apolitical. This, despite them generally urging its citizens to take active interest in the affairs of the country. Why this paradox? The answer is that we want some people to simply &ldquo;carry out&rdquo; what politicians decide is right for the country. They are not supposed to question the decision after it is made. Of course, they are kept in the loop during the decision making process. This example dismisses the notion that greater political activity makes democracy better. If the bureaucracy was actively political it would go &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; to implement what it considers right and eventually ruin itself by destroying its efficiency. This brings to the topic in discussion; that is just how much political activity do we desire from our citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem there is of domain knowledge and authority. The general citizen has little knowledge about most issues. For example, if you ask a person on the street how much money a government have in India the answer is likely to be, that this question is irrelevant as government has lot of money but because of corruption it is not spending it efficiently. But in reality it having overspending problems and has to choose between infrastructure and welfare and subsidies. Now with their lack of domain knowledge, their political activity can rarely contribute positively. This is not to say their say is always irrelevant as in issues like corruption, transparency, inflation, unemployment, their knowledge is greater. Now if we come to a decision, disagreements afterwards or protests not only weakens the value of our decisions but also makes them difficult to implement. This is not to say protesters or that political disagreements are wrong but that we should arrive at a decision after enough consolation that there are no further disagreements. The policy or laws should mark the end of debates and should not increase it. This is what authority means. Once the final decision is taken there should no questioning of the authority over the decision but only implementation and obedience. This largely defines what the most efficient government should be like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political over-activity makes systems rotten and it destroys the process described. For example, citizens or political opposition angry at their plight, start to question established laws/policies, it is still possible to rescue these laws and policies but it is nearly impossible to implement them creating lose-lose scenarios. Neither is the new nor the older policy implemented nor are they important as they can change anytime. Also not all citizens are knowledgeable enough, that they won&rsquo;t become decoys for politicians to win power. For example, in early 1970s, a famine made living conditions of Indians miserable, and the political opposition tried to make use of people&rsquo;s anger to call for reelection so they could win elections meanwhile completely paralyzing the country&rsquo;s economy. So we wasted our time on politics when it gave zero or negative results. So is it true that politics should we given limited time and interest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is striking that if we take statistics, assuming that country/states with one head are generally less politically active then ones with healthy competition, it becomes amply clear that this is true. Indian states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, now Madhya Pradesh, all have little political competition; fare better economically than political hotbeds like Bihar, UP, Bengal which have heavy political followers and goons. Even in Far East Asian countries, which saw miracle growth were politically less active whereas political hotbeds like Middle East or Sub-Saharan Africa are politically active see poor or non-existent governments. So does high levels of political activity adversely affect government&rsquo;s efficiency?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer to this is complex as this is a two way lane. While higher levels of political activity might adversely affect government&rsquo;s efficiency, even an inefficient government forces or draws people&rsquo;s anger and frustration. So we can&rsquo;t clearly conclude the answer. This question is curiously similar to the age old question &ldquo;what came before, the egg or the hen?&rdquo;. Although this gives us the liberty to assume heightened level of political activity, may make a country&rsquo;s policy weak. This is also because with political stability politicians can strongly implement policies which bring prosperity by a way which all might not accept but will succeed sooner or later. This is still better than a weak policy of right way because of better efficiency. Powerful political protest or movement reduce the ability of the government to direct policy in a planned manner to achieve a planned aim, instead forces them to change policies or its objectives to please people in the opposition, but can create a unplanned and weak policy regime. Thus we could conclude that limited political activity is best for any democracy.</p>\r\n', 'Political Activity and Government Efficiency', 0, 0, NULL, 1, 6, 0),

But none of us know what the future holds and how soon the time may come when we are no longer around to support and provide for them.<br />\r\nIt is becoming increasingly important to be doubly insured where the working couple gets covered under one plan helping them plan their future in a better way.<a href="http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Insurance_380.jpg"><img alt="Insurance_380" src="http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Insurance_380.jpg" style="height:285px; width:380px" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do people know this category exists at all? With the changes in family dynamics and better education facilities, a lot of women are now equally contributing to the household expenses. However, unfortunately it has been observed that, women don&rsquo;t take most of the financial decisions, and this could be a reason why most working women even today are not adequately insured.<br />\r\nJoint Life category on a whole is a very comprehensive class, as it offers to cover two lives under one single policy. Most policyholders who name their wives as nominees in the policies, gives them a good chance here to give name them as a joint policyholder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A joint life insurance policy for a couple will prove to be more advantageous than an individual life policy. It helps save premiums, ie: cover two lives under one policy, charging only one premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br />\r\nJoint life insurance policies usually pay out benefits on death of either of the partners after the death of either of the policy holders.. In the past, when people wanted to save on premiums, they often get or draw life insurance to the key person or main breadwinner of their family. However, that situation is fast becoming obsolete since both spouses are now working. Both of them are exposed to various risks, both of them need to be protected from uncertainties of life. Therefore, there should be some kind of measure to ensure that whatever may happen to either of them, there is ample cover for each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong><br />\r\nThere are various types of joint life policies available in the market. One should buy the policy that suits their needs. Some policies pay out all benefits on death of either of the spouses, whereas some pay benefits in parts after the death of first spouse and so on. Most policies available are money-back or endowment kind of policies. This is the most unexplored category and life insurers should innovate and build further up on this as it is the need of the hour</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us choose life insurance policy which is affordable. Joint policies are a convenient way of covering couples. The cost of insuring two people instead of one is cheaper, which in turn affects the price of the policy itself. It is important to remember that the cost and coverage levels that come with joint life insurance cover can vary based on the provider and the plan you choose,&nbsp;as family dynamics and lifestyles are changing. If only one of you has life insurance cover, the peace of mind is only one way, as if the unprotected person dies first the surviving partner gets nothing. However, if you have joint life insurance cover, both parties are protected, so no matter which party passes away first, the other will get a payout to ensure financial security for the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A joint life insurance policy has a reasonable payment option that should never be underestimated or passed over. The policy can be more beneficial and an advantage to young couples who are just starting their life together. The payment received upon the death of the first partner is very significant in comparison to the amount invested in the policy. In all instances, joint life insurance is less expensive than an individual life insurance plan.. Even if the other person stays at home to look after the kids, it is usually worth having some cover for them as if they were to die, childcare costs could be a significant burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from these benefits a joint insurance policy usually provides financial assistance upon diagnosis of a critical illness. Since this situation can cause a lot of stress that may affect your relationship and your family, it is always wise to be prepared for such serious problems that can affect a household in a very negative way as early as possible. A joint term life insurance is a wise investment in future security and financial stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a very crucial decision to choose your life cover out of various types available. It depends on the duration of your need; it can be until you retire or for a certain period of time only, say 10 or 20 years. One should also consider whether the benefit is indexed with the inflation or not. Also if there are any hidden catch to it, are there any exclusions and restrictions. In order to see these things, you can educate yourself by dong a little research, ask the help of an insurance expert, and finally, read the Product Disclosure Statement of your policy where all the details can be found.</p>\r\n', 'Should you go for a single insurance policy for two or individual policies?', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 6, 0),

Marquez, in return, promptly removed his name from that list of likely foes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe they [Team Pacquiao] are interested in that fight, but I no longer am and that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; the 42-year-old Marquez told ESPN Deportes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since knocking Pacquiao out cold with one punch in the sixth round of their 2012 fourth encounter, Marquez has been consistent in turning down offers for a fifth bout and in smashing rumors that he may even be contemplating such a bout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mexican legend and future first ballot Hall of Famer insists that his refusal to entertain the thought of a part five is all about pride and about ending the feud on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The last three fights with Manny [Prior to his knockout of Manny in 2012], I won the fights,&rdquo; Marquez said in a video interview. &ldquo;A lot of people know what happened in those fights. In the first fight, I won a close decision, but [it] was a draw. The second fight, I won another close decision&mdash;maybe two points, three points. In the third fight, I won very clearly&hellip;I won the four fights-- why another fight?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Marquez&rsquo;s eyes, he should be 4-0 against Pacquiao and not 1-2-1. The one punch KO victory in the last bout is the perfect way with which to end the Pacquiao chapter in his career. To him, it was the ideal end to a series of fights riddled with problematic scoring. Sure of not getting a fair shake should they fight again, Marquez instead prefers to pursue a fifth divisional championship to become the first Mexican fighter to accomplish the feat&mdash;or maybe he&rsquo;ll just retire. Reports indicate that he&rsquo;ll make a decision about returning to the ring by the end of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of Manny Pacquiao, though, see things another way when it comes to Marquez and his stubborn reluctance to fight Pacquiao again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They saw a fighter in Marquez who had his nose broken and who seemed to be on his last legs, quickly losing gas against a hard-charging Pacquiao when the final knockout punch&mdash;the boxing equivalent of football&rsquo;s Hail Mary pass&mdash;landed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fifth encounter would take up right where the fourth left off, prior to the knockout punch. Marquez would be ground down, his legs would give in, and Pacquiao would stop him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a stoppage loss to Pacquiao in one final encounter would negate all of the rhetoric Marquez has employed over the years about being cheated. It would remove all doubt as to who, in the grand picture of boxing, was the better fighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marquez, maybe, doesn&rsquo;t want to risk that kind of possibility in what could be his final fight. He wants to go out on top or, at the very least, not in defeat to his arch-rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only Marquez knows Marquez&rsquo;s motivations.

RDO said Al-Hamidi has been hurting his teammates since the start of the match. I actually thought the fouls favoured the Kuwaitis because Andray Blatche and Marc Pingris had a pair of near-phantom calls in the third quarter. When RDO winced in pain they should have called the foul. It&rsquo;s not like De Ocampo would just go and knock Al-Hamidi after that possession &ndash; as he&rsquo;ll probably act all pained and all just to aggravate the nut cracker attempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully there will be less calls of that nature in the future.

(44, 3, '2015-09-26', '04:56:16', '<p>For most democratic countries in the world, it is a norm to keep bureaucracy and military, apart from a host of other bodies like Election Commission, Parliamentary or Experts panels, etc apolitical. This, despite them generally urging its citizens to take active interest in the affairs of the country. Why this paradox? The answer is that we want some people to simply &ldquo;carry out&rdquo; what politicians decide is right for the country. They are not supposed to question the decision after it is made. Of course, they are kept in the loop during the decision making process. This example dismisses the notion that greater political activity makes democracy better. If the bureaucracy was actively political it would go &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; to implement what it considers right and eventually ruin itself by destroying its efficiency. This brings to the topic in discussion; that is just how much political activity do we desire from our citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem there is of domain knowledge and authority. The general citizen has little knowledge about most issues. For example, if you ask a person on the street how much money a government have in India the answer is likely to be, that this question is irrelevant as government has lot of money but because of corruption it is not spending it efficiently. But in reality it having overspending problems and has to choose between infrastructure and welfare and subsidies. Now with their lack of domain knowledge, their political activity can rarely contribute positively. This is not to say their say is always irrelevant as in issues like corruption, transparency, inflation, unemployment, their knowledge is greater. Now if we come to a decision, disagreements afterwards or protests not only weakens the value of our decisions but also makes them difficult to implement. This is not to say protesters or that political disagreements are wrong but that we should arrive at a decision after enough consolation that there are no further disagreements. The policy or laws should mark the end of debates and should not increase it. This is what authority means. Once the final decision is taken there should no questioning of the authority over the decision but only implementation and obedience. This largely defines what the most efficient government should be like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political over-activity makes systems rotten and it destroys the process described. For example, citizens or political opposition angry at their plight, start to question established laws/policies, it is still possible to rescue these laws and policies but it is nearly impossible to implement them creating lose-lose scenarios. Neither is the new nor the older policy implemented nor are they important as they can change anytime. Also not all citizens are knowledgeable enough, that they won&rsquo;t become decoys for politicians to win power. For example, in early 1970s, a famine made living conditions of Indians miserable, and the political opposition tried to make use of people&rsquo;s anger to call for reelection so they could win elections meanwhile completely paralyzing the country&rsquo;s economy. So we wasted our time on politics when it gave zero or negative results. So is it true that politics should we given limited time and interest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is striking that if we take statistics, assuming that country/states with one head are generally less politically active then ones with healthy competition, it becomes amply clear that this is true. Indian states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, now Madhya Pradesh, all have little political competition; fare better economically than political hotbeds like Bihar, UP, Bengal which have heavy political followers and goons. Even in Far East Asian countries, which saw miracle growth were politically less active whereas political hotbeds like Middle East or Sub-Saharan Africa are politically active see poor or non-existent governments. So does high levels of political activity adversely affect government&rsquo;s efficiency?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer to this is complex as this is a two way lane. While higher levels of political activity might adversely affect government&rsquo;s efficiency, even an inefficient government forces or draws people&rsquo;s anger and frustration. So we can&rsquo;t clearly conclude the answer. This question is curiously similar to the age old question &ldquo;what came before, the egg or the hen?&rdquo;. Although this gives us the liberty to assume heightened level of political activity, may make a country&rsquo;s policy weak. This is also because with political stability politicians can strongly implement policies which bring prosperity by a way which all might not accept but will succeed sooner or later. This is still better than a weak policy of right way because of better efficiency. Powerful political protest or movement reduce the ability of the government to direct policy in a planned manner to achieve a planned aim, instead forces them to change policies or its objectives to please people in the opposition, but can create a unplanned and weak policy regime.

The Communist Party of India searched the World for foreign investment when in power in one of India hugely populated States, West Bengal! What makes Capitalism so untouchable in India where Churchill proverb &ldquo;socialism is redistributing poverty&rdquo; looks more true than ever. In countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, why are most Capitalist reforms considered politically difficult pass. Anyone would look at developing countries and think it has more to benefit from Capitalism. Even then, why are these countries finding it tough politically but as only economic solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest reason and surviving obstacle in the way of Capitalism is poverty. A well-off family would want more opportunities, more choices in markets, better future for the next generation, all of which Capitalism provides. But a person in poverty, without proper or useful education is likely to ask for much more help from the government. Unlike Reagan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Government is not the solution but a part of the problem&rdquo; he looks at it as last respite to survival. In Third World countries which were in centre of Cold War, it proved a challenge unsurmountable for politicians to explain to their citizens; the benefit of Capitalism. This also verifies why most countries which benefited from Capitalism to move from developing to developed are Autocratics like South Korea, Taiwan and other East Asian countries. Only way Capitalism has succeeded in these countries is that Social crashes economically forcing the elite, media and politicians to accept Capitalism e.g. India in 1991, China in 1978 etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in negatives, we must not forget that it is now universally accepted that government has no business doing business. This is also accepted in almost all developing countries. But not all is rosy here too as many governments now do not do any business but to &ldquo;protect the interests of downtrodden&rdquo;, they continue one or more public companies in otherwise private sectors or provide price caps or subsidies or overregulate sectors. This has led to less free, distorted Capitalism with little investment and more than required opening up of business sometimes leading to resentment in even the middle-class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heavy subsidies to politically unified or over-represented groups is very common, overspending is a global practice, over-regulation in developing countries to &ldquo;prevent MNCs from making undue profits instead of common man benefiting&rdquo;, but what is clear is this is clearly against Capitalism. Overspending kicks out private sector lending, and subsidies are political stunts and vote collectors. Over-regulation makes ease of doing business tougher while kicking out both domestic and foreign investments. But this criticism of overspending or subsidies or over-regulation is difficult to hold in front of person in poverty who think that this is there only respite. For example, a person in India who is in poverty would support Food Security Act and will not be convinced by our argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to say Capitalism will reduce or die out but it only increase but that we need to eliminate poverty which will provide a much faster and easier path to Capitalism than more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; economic crash method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also need to understand that poverty, and not socialism, &nbsp;is the BIGGEST enemy of capitalism.</p>\r\n', 'Why Capitalism has not won even 25 years after Cold War?', 0, 0, NULL, 1, 6, 0),
(46, 3, '2015-09-26', '04:58:08', '<p>This seems like a regular well done script, bound to repeat itself again and again. Some Indian and Pakistani political leaders get together and discuss the process of peace, not ready to sign a peace deal, but just getting together to talk about a roadmap. They could get so close as to talk about a meeting between some senior level officials, so forward in terms of achieving peace. Even with such a simple first step, the process immediately meets the Pakistani Army gauntlet. The Pakistani army is fighting the Taliban in the western border; but its reason for its high status within the state of Pakistan is an ongoing state of conflict with India. The Pakistani army considers itself the decider of foreign policy with India and does not allow the civilian Government to run any policy regarding this independently.<br />\r\nSo it happened this time as well. The Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India had a meeting where they decided to talk about resuming the peace process, including how to expedite the trial of the people involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks (a subject which is pretty close to the heart of the Indian side). There was a major attacks by alleged LeT terrorists in the Gurdaspur region of Punjab in India, an attach was pretty clear would be a suicidal attack and no escape for the terrorists. It was a matter of good luck that the terrorists did not enter a residential part of the complex; a place where they would have more people to hold hostage and eventually kill (in any case, the death count would have been much higher).<br />\r\nSoon after this terror attack, there were the standard arguments that one would be giving into the hands of the Pakistani army and the ISI if the Indian side took a high ground on this front and decided to hold the talks for some time. Some even went so far as to state that the Indian side should try and make direct contact with the Pakistani army, something that might help more, and create a direct talk that is similar to what is there on the Chinese side of the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This argument seems to me to the most ridiculous kind of twaddle. If the Pakistani Government is not bringing the army to heel, how could any direct contact with the Pakistani army make them give up their strategy of trying to bleed India through a thousand cuts ? And why should the Indian Government seek to reward the Pakistani army by overlooking all their actions in the faint hope that things will get better and they will have common sense. If one talks to people in the Indian intelligence community, they know that the Pakistani army and ISI send in terrorists who are ready to give up their life, they try to bleed India economically by pumping in fake currency (including these to finance their terrorism operations), and also facilitating the entry of drugs into Punjab (and where the complicity of local politicians and even the police has turned this into a huge problem).<br />\r\nThe more such attacks happen, and the more we threaten retaliation without doing anything, the more we present a picture of weakness all around us. The Pakistani effort succeeds because there is no cost involved on their side, just the loss of some terrorists. History teaches us that unless people feel a cost of their strategy, there is no real incentive to rethink the strategy. Even the history of the cold war between the US and the USSR had very little direct action inside their own countries, since one knew that if one started, the others would do so. They were free to take operations in other countries, but not inside the adversary directly. And so it should be with the Indian side, the cost of bleeding should also be transferred to the other country.<br />\r\nThere would be some people who will crib about morality, but morality does not play too much role in relations between countries. India is a country that has the Arthashastra on how to conduct politics and the role of the state, and the paramount importance of the state is to protect its own citizens. Even though Pakistan is bleeding because of its own terror groups, there is a lot more that the Indian covert operations should do. None of this need be announced; there are several ways of ensuring that the Pakistanis get the message.<br />\r\nPumping in fake currency needs to be done; attacking some army areas through hit and run tactics would also convey a message; ensuring that there is some fightback in Karachi where the MQM is taking a hit from the Pakistani army; and most of all, trying to sabotage the efforts by the Chinese to create a corridor from the sea to the Chinese border in POK. Sabotaging the port effort, the railway line and the highway, all of these will have a tremendous impact on the Pakistani military. One might consider such an effort by the Indian covert planners as horrific and wrong, but there is nothing wrong in all this. They will put a cost that would show the Pakistani military and the ISI that maybe they need to rethink their strategy. How long will the Indian side sit back and just try to fight the invaders on Indian soil ?

Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by an average of $1,300. Florida&rsquo;s pro-growth climate created 1.3 million new jobs. And we did it all while balancing the budget eight years in a row and increasing the state&rsquo;s rainy-day fund by $8 billion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s decision to run on his economic record has plenty of precedent. In 1988, Michael Dukakis won the Democratic nomination on the strength of the &ldquo;Massachusetts Miracle,&rdquo; which &mdash; at least in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXy214aFaL8" target="_blank">Dukakis&rsquo;s narrative</a> &mdash; transformed the Bay State into a thriving tech hub. Republican Mitt Romney tried a similar pitch &mdash; about the same state, and with similar results &mdash; 24 years later. And this year, Bush is hardly alone: Eight of the 16 Republican candidates are current or former governors<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-evaluate-the-economic-records-of-governors-who-want-to-be-president/#fn-1">1</a> &mdash; nine of 17 were before Rick Perry dropped out of the race on Friday &mdash; and virtually all of them are, to one degree or another, running on their economic records. (The Democratic side also features two former governors, Martin O&rsquo;Malley and Lincoln Chafee. O&rsquo;Malley, at least, has discussed his economic record as governor of Maryland on the campaign trail.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voters, however, would be wise to view all these candidates&rsquo; claims with skepticism. According to most experts, a governor&rsquo;s power to influence his state&rsquo;s economy is limited at best, especially in the short term. Governors don&rsquo;t decide where oil will be discovered, whether a local company will have a big IPO or whether a major employer will close up shop. Most importantly, they don&rsquo;t control national economic conditions, which can dwarf the effects of decisions made at the state level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, governors certainly have more influence over their states&rsquo; economies than individual senators or business executives. So don&rsquo;t ignore their records entirely &mdash; just put their claims in the appropriate context. Here are a few simple rules for doing just that:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Look beyond their term of office</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The economic numbers Bush cites aren&rsquo;t distortions: He really did lead Florida during a remarkable economic boom. The state&rsquo;s unemployment rate didn&rsquo;t top 6 percent for his entire eight years in office, from 1999 to 2007, and it was under 4 percent for much of that time. The state gained more than a million jobs while he was in office, and household income growth far outpaced the national mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But whatever the merits of Bush&rsquo;s particular policies, his success owed a lot to timing. He ran the state amid a nationwide housing bubble that was particularly pronounced in sunny retirement meccas such as Florida, Arizona and California. Those places also suffered the most in the ensuing bust &mdash; but by then Bush was out of office. By January 2009, just two years after his term ended, Florida&rsquo;s unemployment rate had soared to 9.1 percent, and the state had lost more than half a million jobs. Even today the state is dealing with the aftershocks of the recession that hit mere months after Bush handed over the keys to the governor&rsquo;s mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="casselman-feature-govs-2" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/casselman-feature-govs-2.png?w=610&amp;h=784" style="height:784px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush doesn&rsquo;t deserve blame for the bust, which struck the entire country. But he doesn&rsquo;t deserve much credit for the preceding boom in Florida either. And it certainly doesn&rsquo;t make sense to consider his record during the boom years without also factoring in what came next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s true for evaluating governors in general. Most of the things governors can do to help their states&rsquo; economies &mdash; upgrading infrastructure, improving the business climate, fixing the schools &mdash; take years to bear fruit. Properly assessing their records requires looking at what happened after they left office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Consider the national picture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When Bobby Jindal was sworn in as governor of Louisiana in January 2008, the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent. That turned out to be the best mark of his term so far: After more than seven and a half years of Jindal&rsquo;s leadership, Louisiana&rsquo;s unemployment rate now stands at 6.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the above paragraph leaves out a crucial piece of context: the nationwide recession, which was just beginning when Jindal took office. It&rsquo;s no surprise that Louisiana&rsquo;s economy took a turn for the worse in 2008; the whole country&rsquo;s did. Similarly, Scott Walker doesn&rsquo;t deserve much credit for Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate falling on his watch: He took over in January 2011, after the recession was over, and has been in office for the strongest years of the recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If voters are going to evaluate governors based on big-picture economic statistics like the unemployment rate, they should at least do so in the context of the national economy. Last fall I <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-good-are-incumbent-governors-economic-records/" target="_blank">developed</a> a back-of-the-envelope way of estimating where a state&rsquo;s unemployment rate should be based on the national rate. According to a slightly modified version of that model, Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate has recently improved faster than we would expect, while Louisiana&rsquo;s was better than expected until it jumped in 2014.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-evaluate-the-economic-records-of-governors-who-want-to-be-president/#fn-2">2</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charts below show this comparison for all 10 governors running for president. To be clear, they still don&rsquo;t tell us anything about whether governors were <em>responsible</em> for their states&rsquo; economic performance. And they can&rsquo;t account for special circumstances &mdash; an oil boom in Ohio or a hurricane in New Jersey, for example &mdash; or even for more gradual shifts in how a given state&rsquo;s economy differs from the country&rsquo;s as a whole. But at least they give a sense of whether their states have done better or worse than expected based on national trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="casselman-feature-govs" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/casselman-feature-govs.png?w=610&amp;h=908" style="height:908px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ignore balanced-budget claims</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Governors love to brag about how they balanced their states&rsquo; budgets. They&rsquo;re counting on voters not realizing that, unlike the federal government, virtually all states are <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/state-balanced-budget-requirements.aspx" target="_blank">required</a> &mdash; either by law or by their constitutions &mdash; to have balanced budgets. When Bush boasts that he balanced Florida&rsquo;s budget &ldquo;eight years in a row,&rdquo; that really just means he spent eight years in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, that voters can&rsquo;t dig a bit deeper into governors&rsquo; fiscal stewardship. Did the governor dip into a rainy-day fund to pay for normal expenses? Agree to expensive union contracts that will create fiscal headaches down the road? Make unrealistic assumptions about investment returns in order to make the state pension system look healthier than it really is? Those are signs that a governor has been fiscally irresponsible, even if the budget is nominally balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Context matters here too, of course. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, took over a state that had serious fiscal problems even before the recession led to a sharp drop in tax revenue. When he took office in 2010, Christie <a href="http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-entered-office-deficit-bi/" target="_blank">inherited</a> both a $2.2 billion immediate budget shortfall and an even larger &ldquo;structural deficit&rdquo; based on longer-run tax and spending plans. None of that was his fault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is fair, however, to judge how Christie has managed the challenges. Rather than raise taxes or make big spending cuts, he has made up budget shortfalls in part via <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-christies-budget-claims-a-more-controversial-legacy/2015/04/17/7f8fb066-dece-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html" target="_blank">one-time fixes</a> and by skipping payments to the state pension system &mdash; reneging on an earlier agreement and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/nyregion/christie-wont-be-forced-to-make-pension-payments.html" target="_blank">sparking a prolonged court battle</a>. According to New Jersey&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, the state&rsquo;s structural deficit is <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/nj_structural_deficit_at_102b_nearly_same_as_when.html" target="_blank">nearly as big</a> as it was when Christie took office, and the state&rsquo;s bond rating has been <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/04/nj_credit_rating_cut_record_ninth_time_as_moodys_c.html" target="_blank">downgraded repeatedly</a> on his watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Follow the money</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When governors talk about the economy on the campaign trail, they often point to the kind of macroeconomic indicators that are already familiar to voters &mdash; job growth, the unemployment rate and personal income, among others. But in evaluating their records, it probably makes sense to focus on what they can actually control: the state budget. Governors get to propose the budget and, especially if their party controls the state legislature, have significant influence over how taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Kasich, for example, has overseen Ohio during a strong economic recovery. Whether or not he deserves much credit for that resurgence &mdash; which has come amid both the national recovery and a major oil boom &mdash; it has given Kasich much more money to spend. He has <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/03/what_has_gov_john_kasich_reall.html" target="_blank">boosted education spending</a>, created an earned income tax credit to help low-income workers and cut taxes by billions of dollars. Unlike most Republican governors, he also chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act; the federal government is covering the extra cost now, but the state will have to pick up part of the bill in the future. The libertarian Cato Institute has <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/kasichs-fiscal-record" target="_blank">criticized Kasich</a> for increasing spending from the general fund 18 percent during his term; <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/08/05/kasich-libertarian-group-battle-over-budget.html" target="_blank">Kasich says</a> overall spending grew by less than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to look not just at how much governors increase spending or cut taxes, but how they do it. Kasich described his school-funding plan as an effort to boost spending in low-income districts, but an <a href="https://stateimpact.npr.org/ohio/2013/02/06/details-of-kasich-school-funding-plan-include-some-surprises/" target="_blank">independent analysis</a> of the plan by NPR found that in many cases it would do the opposite. (The state legislature ultimately rejected Kasich&rsquo;s plan, and he used his line-item veto to <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/06/30/Kasich_budget_vetoes.html" target="_blank">cut funding</a> from the version lawmakers passed instead.) His tax cuts have <a href="http://www.policymattersohio.org/taxplan-june2015" target="_blank">gone mostly</a> to the wealthy and to businesses; he has proposed phasing out Ohio&rsquo;s progressive income tax and <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/02/02/gov-john-kasich-budget-proposal.html" target="_blank">raising the sales tax</a>, which tends to hit poorer households harder since they spend a larger share of their income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the details of Kasich&rsquo;s plans make him more or less attractive is a matter of political philosophy &mdash; his tax plan has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/05/18/gov-kasichs-winning-proposal-for-ohio-lowering-income-taxes/" target="_blank">won praise</a> from some conservative economists who think it will boost economic growth, while it has been <a href="http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/archive/2015/08/johns_kasichs_uncompassionate.php#.VfWFcPlVgSU" target="_blank">criticized by progressives</a> as favoring the rich over the poor. But evaluating his actual record on taxes and spending makes much more sense than focusing on how many jobs were created while he was in office.</p>\r\n', 'How To Evaluate The Economic Records Of Governors Who Want To Be President', 0, 0, NULL, 1, 6, 0);

If you&rsquo;re a Republican, Trump is as familial as the vacuum salesman knocking on your door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the following. We&rsquo;ll start with some of the more superficial differences between Sanders and Trump and work our way to the more important ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Trump is &ldquo;winning&rdquo; (for now), and Sanders isn&rsquo;t. </strong>There are <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-six-stages-of-doom/">lots of reasons</a> to suspect that Trump will fall from his position atop the GOP polls sooner or later, but he&rsquo;d be a favorite to win a hypothetical national primary held today. Sanders, by contrast, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html">trails Hillary Clinton</a> by about 20 percentage points in national polls that include Joe Biden, and by 30 points in polls that don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Sanders is campaigning on substantive policy positions, and Trump is largely campaigning on the force of his personality. </strong>I&rsquo;m not sure this assertion requires a lot of proof, but if you need some, check out the candidates&rsquo; websites. Sanders&rsquo;s lists <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">dozens of specific policy proposals</a> across a wide range of issues; Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions">details his position on just one</a>, immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-08 at 8.55.00 PM" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-08-at-8-55-00-pm.png?w=610&amp;h=364" style="height:364px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Sanders is a career politician; Trump isn&rsquo;t. </strong>Let&rsquo;s not neglect this obvious one. Bernie Sanders has been in Congress since 1991, making him one of the <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/politics/houseseniority.html">most senior members of Congress</a>; Trump has never officially run a political campaign before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Trump is getting considerably more media attention. </strong>Trump is a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-running-a-perpetual-attention-machine/">perpetual attention machine</a> who gets a disproportionate amount of media coverage &mdash; as much as the rest of the GOP field combined. Sanders hasn&rsquo;t been ignored by the press, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clinton-scandal-inevitable-problems/">which wants a horse race</a> between Sanders (or Biden, or anyone!!!) and Clinton. Still, Sanders&rsquo;s media coverage has been paltry compared with Trump&rsquo;s. According to <a href="https://news.search.yahoo.com/search?p=donald+trump&amp;fr=uh3_news_web_gs&amp;fr2=p%3Anews%2Cm%3Asb">Yahoo News</a>, Trump has received about 35,000 media &ldquo;hits&rdquo; in the past month, compared with about 9,000 for Sanders. For comparison, Clinton has had 18,000 hits over the same period, and Jeb Bush has had 14,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/"><img alt="Candidate Approvals" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/candidate_approvals_grey1-15.png?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=153&amp;h=115" style="height:115px; width:153px" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INTERACTIVE:</strong> We&rsquo;re tracking 2016 presidential primary endorsements. <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">Check out the most important race before the actual race &raquo;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Sanders has a much better &ldquo;ground game.&rdquo; </strong>Trump, in addition to his ubiquity on television, has <a href="http://www.p2016.org/trump/trumporg.html">some semblance of a campaign operation</a>. But Sanders&rsquo;s organization is <a href="http://www.p2016.org/sanders/sandersorg.html">much larger and more experienced</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Sanders holds policy positions of a typical liberal Democrat; Trump&rsquo;s are all over the place. </strong>While Sanders <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/bernie-sanders-2016-democrats-121181">doesn&rsquo;t officially call himself a Democrat</a> &mdash; a fact that might annoy Democratic elites &mdash; he takes policy positions that are consistent with those of Democrats in Congress. In the previous Congress (113th), Sanders voted the same as liberal Democratic senators Barbara Boxer, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Sherrod Brown 95 percent of the time or more.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-comparing-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders/#fn-1">1</a> He voted with party leader Harry Reid 91 percent of the time and the expressed position of President Obama<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-comparing-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders/#fn-2">2</a> 93 percent of the time. He also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html">voted with Clinton 93 percent of the time</a> when the two were in the Senate together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the senators Sanders voted with most and least often in the 113th Congress, according to <a href="http://www.voteview.com/">Voteview.org</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th colspan="1">SENATOR</th>\r\n			<th colspan="1">MOST OFTEN</th>\r\n			<th colspan="1">SENATOR</th>\r\n			<th colspan="1">LEAST OFTEN</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Boxer (CA)</td>\r\n			<td>96.2%</td>\r\n			<td>Manchin (WV)</td>\r\n			<td>82.1%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Markey (MA)</td>\r\n			<td>95.9</td>\r\n			<td>Baucus (MT)</td>\r\n			<td>87.4</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Booker (NJ)</td>\r\n			<td>95.8</td>\r\n			<td>Pryor (AR)</td>\r\n			<td>87.6</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Cantwell (WA)</td>\r\n			<td>95.8</td>\r\n			<td>Donnelly (IN)</td>\r\n			<td>89.9</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Leahy (VT)</td>\r\n			<td>95.7</td>\r\n			<td>Hagan (NC)</td>\r\n			<td>90.0</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Gillibrand (NY)</td>\r\n			<td>95.7</td>\r\n			<td>Heitkamp (ND)</td>\r\n			<td>90.2</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Brown (OH)</td>\r\n			<td>95.7</td>\r\n			<td>Lautenberg (NJ)</td>\r\n			<td>90.6</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Hirono (HI)</td>\r\n			<td>95.4</td>\r\n			<td>Tester (MT)</td>\r\n			<td>90.6</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Menendez (NJ)</td>\r\n			<td>95.4</td>\r\n			<td>Landrieu (LA)</td>\r\n			<td>90.6</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Stabenow (MI)</td>\r\n			<td>95.4</td>\r\n			<td>Reid (NV)</td>\r\n			<td>91.4</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s positions are harder to pin down &mdash; and he doesn&rsquo;t have a voting record to evaluate &mdash; but he has far more profound potential differences with the Republican orthodoxy on major issues ranging from taxation to health care to reproductive rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Sanders&rsquo;s support divides fairly clearly along ideological and demographic lines; Trump&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t. </strong>So far, Sanders <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/">has won a lot of support from white liberals</a> &mdash; which helps him in Iowa and New Hampshire &mdash; but not so much from white moderates or non-white Democrats. Each of these groups represents about a third of the Democratic primary electorate nationally, so this makes Sanders&rsquo;s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/this-is-how-bernie-sanders-could-win/">path to the Democratic nomination</a> fairly easily to analyze; he&rsquo;ll be viable only to the extent that he gains support among the other two groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s support, by contrast, is fairly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/politics/why-donald-trump-wont-fold-polls-and-people-speak.html">evenly spread across a range of demographic and ideological groups</a> that appear in Republican polls. He doesn&rsquo;t do especially well (or especially poorly) with &ldquo;tea party&rdquo; voters, for instance. There are a variety of ways to interpret this &mdash; perhaps, even, the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/423607/donald-trump-conservative-movement-jonah-goldberg">Trumpen proletariat</a>&rdquo; is a group all its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Sanders&rsquo;s candidacy has clear historical precedents; they&rsquo;re less obvious for Trump. </strong>Even the most formidable-seeming front-runners haven&rsquo;t won their nominations without some semblance of a fight. Clinton&rsquo;s position relative to Sanders is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-sanders-vs-clinton-new-hampshire-replays-past-splits/2015/09/07/072ac4ec-5581-11e5-b8c9-944725fcd3b9_story.html">analogous</a> to the one Al Gore held against Bill Bradley in the 2000 Democratic primary. Sanders&rsquo;s campaign also has parallels to liberal stalwarts from Howard Dean to Eugene McCarthy; these candidates can have an impact on the race, but they <em>usually</em> don&rsquo;t win the nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has some commonalities also: to &ldquo;bandwagon&rdquo; candidates like Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain; to media-savvy, factional candidates like Pat Buchanan; and to self-funded candidates like Steve Forbes. None of those candidates, however, was as <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/08/06/why-donald-trumps-hostile-takeover-bid-for-the-republican-party-is-a-loser/">openly hostile to their party</a> as Trump is with Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Trump is running against a field of 16 candidates; Sanders is running against one overwhelming front-runner. </strong>Trump is also in new territory in another respect. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/01/29/what_if_no_one_wins_the_gop_presidential_nomination_125426.html">never been a Republican nomination race</a> &mdash; or for that matter a Democratic one &mdash; with so many declared candidates. Most of the Republicans are not tokenish candidates either. All but Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have served as senators or governors before, many of them in highly populous states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This unprecedented volume of candidates helps Trump in various ways. For instance, it <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/">increases the value of differentiating yourself from the field</a>. Unorthodox or even unpopular policy positions may <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-winning-the-polls-and-losing-the-nomination/">help you win a faction of the Republican electorate</a>, even if it makes you less popular within your party overall. That faction may be enough to carry the plurality in polls, leading to favorable media coverage and then creating a virtuous cycle that attracts some <a href="http://researchdmr.com/Why_Are_Polls_Self_Fulfilling_Prophecies">bandwagon voters</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the abundance of candidates seems to have resulted in the Republican establishment <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-republican-establishment-is-waiting-on-the-sidelines/">holding off on throwing its support to any one candidate</a>, either through <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">endorsements</a> or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/seeing-crowd-gop-donors-holding-back.html">in the money race</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic establishment, by contrast, has <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/republicans-are-acting-like-democrats-democrats-are-acting-like-republicans/">never been so united</a> behind any non-incumbent candidate as they are with Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Stop Comparing Donald Trump And Bernie Sanders', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 6, 0),
(50, 3, '2015-09-26', '05:11:54', '<p>Moldy New Orleans still lay in ruins in January of 2006 as Joe Canizaro drove me to a favorite Italian restaurant of his in the city&rsquo;s suburbs. It was a balmy Sunday, just four months after the catastrophic collapse of the city&rsquo;s flood protection system, and Canizaro asked me a question I&rsquo;ve never been able to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Gary, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canizaro &mdash; a big-name real estate developer in town &mdash; was due to deliver an official plan for redeveloping New Orleans the next day. But he confessed that he was still struggling with it. The question he asked was simple but profound: Should the authorities rebuild all of New Orleans after the flood? Or should they &ldquo;shrink the footprint&rdquo; and declare the lowest-lying areas of the city off-limits, converting large tracts of land into green space?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nola.com/katrina/index.ssf/2015/05/footprint_gentrification_katri.html">Great Katrina Footprint Debate</a>,&rdquo; as Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella would dub it, became a long-running public tussle over people&rsquo;s right to rebuild wherever they wanted, even if that meant they were putting themselves in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-Mayor Ray Nagin had named Canizaro, a personal friend of then-President George W. Bush, to the panel he assembled to put together a plan for rebuilding New Orleans, where 110,000 homes and 20,000 businesses had flooded. Canizaro was a rich white Republican from the suburbs, equipped with Karl Rove&rsquo;s cell phone number, who had been either brave or foolish enough to volunteer to put together the redevelopment plan &mdash; a job that his fellow panel members were happy to have handed to him. And he had turned to me &mdash; then a reporter for The New York Times &ldquo;storm team&rdquo; who had a tourist&rsquo;s knowledge of New Orleans &mdash; to help him make up his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would demur on that day. But for 10 years, I&rsquo;ve been grappling with that question, first as a reporter for the Times and then as an author of <a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/Katrina/Gary-Rivlin/9781451692228">a book about the rebuilding of New Orleans</a>. Coming up with the right answer is for me as difficult today as it was then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who argued in favor of shrinking usually began by citing census figures. The city&rsquo;s population had peaked at 627,525 people in 1960, but that was before the integration of the public schools and the white flight that saw 160,000 people leave the city over the next two decades. By the time of Katrina, New Orleans had an estimated 455,000 residents &mdash; and with maybe 100,000 left a few months after the storm, who knew, Canizaro and others were asking, if the population would get back to even 300,000?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure if you&rsquo;re missing 40 percent of your original population, then there&rsquo;s going to be shrinkage in the amount of land that&rsquo;s going to be needed,&rdquo; Canizaro said to me on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 2006, with his big decision barely a week away. And yet he confessed that he wasn&rsquo;t ready to declare a death sentence for any New Orleans neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geographers didn&rsquo;t seem to have any trouble reaching a similar consensus on the need to shrink the city&rsquo;s footprint. Craig Colton, who taught geography at LSU, heard from colleagues around the country in the weeks after Katrina. To them, the only question was whether 20 percent or 40 percent of the city&rsquo;s landmass should revert to wetlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly where I would draw the line, but I assume that&rsquo;s what the city is trying to figure out right now,&rdquo; Colton had told me a couple of months after the storm. Roughly half the city sat below sea level, Colton said, but that didn&rsquo;t mean he would decree half the city out of bounds. A community sitting a few feet below sea level might be deemed an &ldquo;intermediate zone,&rdquo; where people would be permitted to rebuild &mdash; if homes were jacked up high enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The city needs to choose some level below sea level and declare it economically unfeasible to build in areas that are at that elevation or lower,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="rivlin-nola-feature-nolahousing-map" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rivlin-nola-feature-nolahousing-map.png?w=610&amp;h=600" style="height:600px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colton&rsquo;s colleague Bruce Sharky, a professor of landscape architecture at LSU, specialized in land use issues. Sharky, too, said he thought it would be irresponsible to rebuild all of New Orleans. He started making regular trips to the city shortly after the floodwaters receded (accomplished in three weeks despite the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&rsquo; estimate that it would take at least 80 days). He had seen the enormity of the disaster that had befallen New Orleans East, parts of which sat 7 feet below sea level, and Lakeview, a neighborhood on the west side of the city where the average home sat 3 feet below sea level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The government is going to spend, what, $100 billion or more to rebuild New Orleans &mdash; and for what?&rdquo; Sharky asked a few months after Katrina. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t do things differently, it can happen again next year.&rdquo;<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-plan-to-shrink-new-orleans-after-katrina-failed/#fn-1">1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money was very much on Canizaro&rsquo;s mind in early 2006. He asked me to imagine the cost of providing police, fire protection, garbage pickup, and other city services to half-built neighborhoods in low-lying New Orleans. Every expert was telling him the same thing: The city couldn&rsquo;t afford to let every last neighborhood come back. Fewer people meant less tax revenue and therefore less money to spend on everything from police and fire to street repairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet by that point, Canizaro was admitting that it was inevitable that he would duck the tough call and not prohibit low-lying neighborhoods from rebuilding. He was a white man leading the redevelopment of a city that was two-thirds black. Of the 353,000 people living in a part of the city that flooded, 265,000 were black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, a lot of poor African-Americans had everything they own destroyed here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So we have to be careful about dictating what&rsquo;s going to happen, especially me as a white man.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Race was a vital element of the Great Footprint Debate &mdash; and for me (also white), it turned a hard decision into an impossible one. For decades, racial covenants and discriminatory lending policies in the city meant black homeownership had been restricted to only a few neighborhoods. Barbara Major, the co-chairwoman of the mayoral panel on which Canizaro served, noted that there was a reason why so many black families lived in New Orleans East, as she did, and in other low-lying parts of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Black people only moved there because all the high ground had been taken,&rdquo; said Major, who is black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Logan, a sociology professor at Brown University, <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2005-06/05-068.html">broke down by race</a> (and other factors) the makeup of the blocks that Canizaro&rsquo;s experts wanted to leave uninhabited. They were talking about land that housed 80 percent of the city&rsquo;s black population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you tell those residents, many of them longing to return home? &ldquo;Look, sorry, we know that was the only land where you could pursue the dream of homeownership, but you&rsquo;re going to have to find another place to live?&rdquo; New Orleans East was mostly swampland in the 1960s when developers started building in the area. By 2005, it was home to 96,000 people, or one-fifth of the city&rsquo;s population, and it was where much of the city&rsquo;s black middle and professional classes lived, along with a large portion of its black elites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It would kill the black psyche if New Orleans East isn&rsquo;t rebuilt,&rdquo; said Tangeyon Wall, who, along with her husband, had bought a home in one of the area&rsquo;s middle-tier subdivisions in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were other issues, of course, starting with property rights. &ldquo;This is America&rdquo; was a popular refrain voiced by black and white residents alike during the debate over the city&rsquo;s future. If they had the money, people said, who was the government to tell them they couldn&rsquo;t rebuild?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution devised by Canizaro was borrowed from the outside planners in plentiful supply in New Orleans in those first months after Katrina: Arm communities with the same elevation data the government had been using when it considered turning large parts of the city into green space. Give them access to the same range of planners and demographers and geologists that were advising Canizaro. Each neighborhood would then have four months to submit a plan that proves its long-term viability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how do you define &ldquo;viability&rdquo;? Was it a commitment from 50 percent of a community&rsquo;s residents that they would rebuild? Seventy percent? The impracticality of making these choices helped doom the plan, which was immediately unpopular in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nagin rejected the proposal because he was in the middle of a tough re-election campaign. His good friend David White, another suburban resident on the rebuilding panel, was among those telling Nagin that to embrace Canizaro&rsquo;s plan was to commit political suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I told him that from a planning standpoint, it probably made a lot of sense,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;But from a human standpoint, it made no sense at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, no neighborhoods were declared off-limits. But driving around New Orleans these days, it&rsquo;s still not obvious that was the correct answer. Lakeview, a prosperous white community, looks better than it did before the storm. Some residents have elevated their houses, and the city is now better protected than it was pre-Katrina, after the federal government spent $14.5 billion to rebuild the levees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet those I spoke with estimate that New Orleans East is only about 80 percent back, and that the Seventh Ward, a black working-class neighborhood, is maybe 60 percent back.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-plan-to-shrink-new-orleans-after-katrina-failed/#fn-2">2</a> In the Lower Ninth Ward, where the average resident was living on $16,000 a year before the hurricane, the population is only 36 percent of what it was. In many of those neighborhoods, there are only a few houses on some blocks, raising the same questions about the long-term cost to the city of providing services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff Thomas, a lawyer who worked in a special unit run by the city&rsquo;s recovery czar in the first years after the flood, looks back on the Great Debate as a high-minded argument with no basis in reality. He sees the idea of seizing people&rsquo;s property as &ldquo;a nonstarter, constitutional law-wise, and also because of funding issues.&rdquo; Over coffee earlier this year, Thomas laid out the steps the city would have needed to take before bringing in the bulldozers and converting a neighborhood back to swampland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You firstly have to justify the eminent domain of an entire community, &ldquo; Thomas said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have universal buy-in to be bought out, which here you wouldn&rsquo;t have, you then have to say why that neighborhood or that one. But in the context of New Orleans, you&rsquo;re going to be hard-pressed to demonstrate that one neighborhood in the bowl is less safe than another neighborhood in the bowl.&rdquo; (The bowl refers to the many sections of central New Orleans that are below sea level.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if somehow the city got past that threshold? &ldquo;Then you have to individually buy out hundreds, if not thousands of properties in that community at fair market values,&rdquo; Thomas continued. By way of comparison, Thomas mentioned the 40 acres the city gave to the federal government so it would build a new Veterans Affairs hospital near the center of town rather than in the suburbs. &ldquo;That meant buying out approximately 160 buildings,&rdquo; said Thomas, who worked on that deal for a good portion of his time inside City Hall, &ldquo;and that costs $75 million.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those pushing the city to take bold action after Katrina, however, already had an answer to that. &ldquo;We need an FDR or someone like that who says, &lsquo;This is hard, but this is for the collective good,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Sharky, one of the LSU professors. &ldquo;You take that $100 billion and say here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to make a safer New Orleans, with better schools and better infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Why The Plan To Shrink New Orleans Failed', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 6, 0);

We&rsquo;ve spent the last week trying to answer that question and have compiled 2015 homicide data for the 60 biggest cities. The results confirm that there has been an increase in homicides this year in big U.S. cities of about 16 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t come close to reversing the long-term decline in homicides. And it&rsquo;s a less dire picture than the one painted by reports in several large media outlets, which generally highlighted those cities that have suffered the biggest increase in homicides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reports have been based on just a small, possibly cherry-picked sampling of cities. The country&rsquo;s broken crime-data system makes it impossible to know what&rsquo;s happening everywhere, and the &ldquo;if it bleeds, it leads&rdquo; journalistic imperative means the places we hear about often are the biggest outliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wave of crime-wave reporting began this spring with <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/07/01/418555852/nationwide-crime-spike-has-law-enforcement-retooling-their-approach">NPR</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/us/crime-in-america/">CNN</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32995911">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/09/us-cities-homicide-surge-2015/29879091/">USA Today</a>, based on just a handful of cities. In August, after the <a href="https://www.majorcitieschiefs.com/">Major Cities Chiefs Association</a> <a href="https://www.majorcitieschiefs.com/">(MCCA)</a> announced results of a survey of a few dozen of its members about crime in their cities, many other outlets &mdash; including <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/03/us-usa-police-summit-idUSKCN0Q81RB20150803">Reuters</a>, <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-police-chiefs-meet-to-address-spike-in-violent-crime/2899151.html">Voice of America</a> and <a href="http://time.com/3982324/violence-america-homicide/">Time</a> &mdash; added to the chorus. And last week, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/murder-rates-rising-sharply-in-many-us-cities.html">The New York Times</a> put the crime wave on its front page, saying that &ldquo;cities across the nation are seeing a startling rise in murders.&rdquo; The Times article was accompanied by a chart showing crime trends in 10 cities, which in turn provoked refutations from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/04/the-crime-wave-in-u-s-cities-doesnt-show-up-in-the-data/?postshare=5261441379618966">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/09/04/about-those-rising-murder-rates-not-so-fast">the Marshall Project</a>, based on fewer than 20 cities each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally we&rsquo;d have current data for all of the roughly 18,000 U.S. police departments that report their crime numbers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, just as we have up-to-date information on employment and other economic trends. But the latest numbers from the FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program can&rsquo;t tell us anything about crime this year: They run through June 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we narrowed our focus to the 60 most populous cities in the country &mdash; 60, because the 10 highlighted by the Times ranged from No. 1 (New York City) to No. 60 (St. Louis). For each city, we sought the year-to-date and year-ago homicide counts, the crime figures that researchers say are the least subjective and hardest for departments to manipulate. We set out to get as close to a complete data set as we could from media reports, the chiefs survey and the websites of state UCR programs and city police departments &mdash; with some help from leads suggested in response to <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlBialik/status/641727159908847617">a call for help on Twitter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we couldn&rsquo;t find the data published anywhere, we contacted the departments &mdash; and as a byproduct got some insight into the wide variation in crime-reporting capabilities even among the nation&rsquo;s biggest cities. Some departments got back to us within a couple of hours (e.g., Phoenix and Raleigh, N.C.). Several had the data on their website, broken down by month and going back several years (<a href="https://www.tulsapolice.org/content/crime-numbers-ucr.aspx">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>, and <a href="http://www.riversideca.gov/rpd/crstats/cstats.asp">Riverside, California</a>). Others treated the inquiries as public-records requests and said they&rsquo;d need up to 10 days to get back to us (Anaheim, California).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, the data is a bit of a mishmash. Some is from media reports, which tend to include homicide numbers in articles about a cluster of homicides, so they could be skewed slightly upward. Some cities had data only through May 31; others sent us numbers through Monday. Some media reports used vague end dates such as &ldquo;mid-August&rdquo; or somewhere between Aug. 11 and 31; for those, we estimated a date. Some of the media reports we relied on showed totals for murders, and cities generally follow FBI reporting conventions in removing homicides <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expanded-homicide-data">that are ruled justified</a> from their counts. We traded some reliability and comparability of data for timeliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ended up with homicide numbers for all of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/index.html">60 biggest cities</a>. And in 26 of them, homicides were up by 20 percent or more from a year ago. Overall, homicides were up by 16 percent.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-1">1</a> But the picture varies a lot by city: Homicides <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/murder-rates-rising-sharply-in-many-us-cities.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0">are up 76 percent</a> in Milwaukee, but <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/13/homicides-tallied-far-this-year-boston/DMDm5WO8sQ4v8cwNwb7DHM/story.html">down 43 percent</a> in Boston.

these changes aren&rsquo;t statistically significant on a city level. Even amid the national upward trend, and in some of the country&rsquo;s most populous cities, homicides remain, thankfully, a rare event. That means some increases that look large on a percentage basis affect the raw totals only slightly, to an extent that could arise by chance alone. A 20 percent increase in Seattle sounds a lot more significant than <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/police/seastat/Meetings/SeaStat_ppt_20150902.pdf">an increase</a> to 18 homicides from 15 through Aug. 29. Homicides in Arlington, Texas, through Aug. 31 are down by 50 percent &mdash; to four from eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine whether changes like these were statistically significant, we estimated how likely it would be to see the changes we&rsquo;ve seen in the cities by chance alone. In doing so we followed the lead of Bruce Frederick, a senior research fellow at the Vera Institute of Justice, who wrote a commentary article on the subject for <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/09/04/about-those-rising-murder-rates-not-so-fast">the Marshall Project</a> last week.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-2">2</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general idea is this: Assume the 2014 homicide rate is the true rate and then calculate how much of a statistical outlier this year&rsquo;s rate is. If the 2015 rate would have arisen by chance alone less than 5 percent of the time, we deem it statistically meaningful.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-3">3</a> In 16 of the 60 cities, there was a significant increase; we&rsquo;d expect about three cities to show an increase that big by chance alone. In two cities &mdash; Boston and Arlington &mdash; there was a significant decrease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that most cities have not shown a significant increase in homicides over the last year. But the overall increase of the cities is highly statistically significant. It&rsquo;s the same principle that governs the interpretation of a national presidential poll: The sample of respondents in any one state could be so small that there isn&rsquo;t enough data to say where the race stands there, even if together the states give one candidate a big nationwide lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, there are some big reasons not to assume that crime is on a long-term increase. While a 16 percent increase in U.S. major-city homicides is statistically significant, it comes after decades of declines &mdash; the murder rate fell by more than half nationally from its peak in 1980 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="bialik-feature-crimedata-1" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/bialik-feature-crimedata-1.png?w=610&amp;h=475" style="height:475px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And big annual fluctuations <a href="http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/">aren&rsquo;t unusual</a>. For instance, in 2009, 17 of today&rsquo;s 60 most populous cities had statistically significant decreases in the number of homicides, while just four had increases. In 1998, those numbers were 20 and four, respectively. Just a decade ago, in 2005, there were 15 cities with significant increases, roughly as many as this year. In 1986, 28 cities had significant increases; just two had decreases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="bialik-feature-crimedata-2" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/bialik-feature-crimedata-2.png?w=610&amp;h=515" style="height:515px; width:610px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big jump or fall in murders in a city in one year could be <a href="http://www.jeffasherconsulting.com/#%21The-Fatal-Shooting-Percentage-Explaining-Why-Murder-is-Rising-in-NOLA/c1mat/555119530cf298b2d3ae5e16">a statistical fluke</a> (variation in the percentage of gunshot victims who die from year to year) or the result of factors that subside the next year &mdash; for instance, this year has been <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/service/global/map-percentile-mntp/201501-201507.gif">unusually hot</a>, and hot weather has been associated with higher crime in <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/some-it-hot-summer-crime-increase-linked-higher-temperatures-better-weather-288944">some studies</a>. We asked cities to send us their data for years before 2014, and 10 provided numbers for 2013. In seven of them, whatever the trend has been this year reversed the trend from a year earlier. For example, <a href="http://www.riversideca.gov/rpd/crstats/cstats.asp">there were five homicides</a> in Riverside this year through July 31. That&rsquo;s down from nine through July 31, 2014 &mdash; which was up from five through the same date in 2013. In <a href="https://www.tulsapolice.org/content/crime-numbers-ucr.aspx">Tulsa</a>, the homicide count through July 31 was 38 in 2013, 21 last year and 38 this year. In these cities, it&rsquo;s 2014, not 2015, that looks like the outlier. And that may be true more broadly: The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/preliminary-semiannual-uniform-crime-report-january-june-2014/tables/table-4/table-4/view">latest UCR report</a> for cities with at least 100,000 people shows that total homicides in the cities in the first six months of 2014 were down by 10 percent from the same period in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our data-collection effort also allows us to compare the cities whose homicide data was included in prior compilations with those whose data wasn&rsquo;t. And what we found is that The New York Times highlighted cities with unusually large increases. The Times published a table showing homicide data for 10 cities. Cumulatively, homicides were up 28 percent in those cities. In the other 50 cities for which we gathered data, homicides were up only 9 percent. The text of the Times table specified that it only showed cities where murder rates were up from a year ago. The article also mentioned that &ldquo;homicides remain at a relatively steady rate this year&rdquo; in a few cities but didn&rsquo;t provide data for those cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we set out on our own data-gathering exercise, we asked the Times for more information about the homicide data in cities where the numbers hadn&rsquo;t increased so far this year and that weren&rsquo;t included in its table. Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha replied in an email, &ldquo;Our story discussed the rising murder rates in more than 30 cities and went into detail on some of them. The story also made clear that there are cities where the murder rate is not increasing. We are not going to discuss the story in further detail.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cities with bigger homicide increases also were overrepresented in the data from the chiefs survey. The 26 cities among the 60 largest in population whose police departments responded to the MCCA survey showed a cumulative increase of 22 percent.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-4">4</a> Cities that did not appear in the survey results or the Times table had only a 5 percent increase in homicides.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-5">5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darrel Stephens, executive director of the <a href="https://www.majorcitieschiefs.com/">MCCA</a>, acknowledged the potential flaws in his group&rsquo;s survey in an interview last month. &ldquo;It was one of those quick-and-dirty surveys,&rdquo; Stephens said. &ldquo;It had no scientific validity at all. It was to get a quick picture of what was taking place across the country.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;A real survey guy probably wouldn&rsquo;t give it much credence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fewer than half of the U.S. police <a href="https://www.majorcitieschiefs.com/members.php">departments that are members</a> <a href="https://www.majorcitieschiefs.com/members.php">of the group</a> responded to the survey, which was conducted using the informal kind of SurveyMonkey poll <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/poll-of-pollsters/">we&rsquo;ve used</a> to survey pollsters.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-6">6</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all its flaws, the chiefs survey marked a significant advance in our knowledge of 2015 crime rates in big cities. The 32 cities that participated are 32 more than have 2015 data available in FBI UCR reports. They&rsquo;re updated online only through June 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Year-old data is like looking at a star through a telescope,&rdquo; Milwaukee police Chief Edward Flynn said in a telephone interview. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know what light was like on that star 2 million years ago, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about what is happening now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flynn is frustrated with the data disconnect faced by big-city police departments. Many of them employ data analysts and track their stats in real time &mdash; Flynn has 16 analysts, up from zero when he took over the department in 2008, and he rattled off his city&rsquo;s crime stats from memory. Yet he and his peers must rely on informal exchanges and potentially skewed media reports to find out what crime trends those in other big departments are seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to Google newspapers and find out what&rsquo;s happening in cities that are similar to us,&rdquo; Flynn said. &ldquo;There is no one-stop shopping for that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some chiefs don&rsquo;t do any data shopping at all. &ldquo;In Metro Atlanta there are about 60 law-enforcement agencies,&rdquo; <a href="http://www2.gsu.edu/%7Ecrirxf/friedmann/index.htm">Robbie Friedmann</a>, professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University, said in an email. &ldquo;I have never seen any sharing beyond jurisdictional boundaries.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flynn and other <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-chiefs-from-around-the-country-meet-in-dc-to-discuss-violent-summer/2015/08/03/e2ec8a9c-3a06-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html?tid=hpModule_13097a0c-868e-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394&amp;hpid=z10">police chiefs met</a> in Washington, D.C., last month to discuss the crime spike some were seeing in their cities. They identified potential factors that could account for the concurrent increase in distant cities, such as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-heroin-epidemics-toll-one-county-70-minutes-eight-overdoses/2015/08/23/f616215e-48bc-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html">the growth of the heroin trade</a> and of criminals&rsquo; use of automatic weapons; inadequate services for offenders to return to civilian life when they are released from prison; and a decrease in federal funding for local policing.<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/scare-headlines-exaggerated-the-u-s-crime-wave/#fn-7">7</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they discussed the difficulty chiefs face in getting data from one another&rsquo;s cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You look at economic data, at labor data, at all kinds of data the government collects that is immediately available,&rdquo; Stephens said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything like that in policing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There would inevitably be some problems with immediate release of national crime data. One concern is that data police departments submit is subject to revision. Some departments succumb to political pressure and suppress crime numbers. A more systemic problem is that departments <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989004575652773618020254">don&rsquo;t all define</a> some crimes, such as assault, the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compiling the data currently takes a long time. State governments check the data submitted locally and then the FBI does the same, collating it from roughly 18,000 departments. That process can take more than a year, partly because participation is voluntary, and local agencies that do decide to report the data for a given year can wait to do so until April of the next year, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer Jr. said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Stephens of the chiefs association counters that economic data often gets revised after release, too. The provisional data still has value &mdash; there is plenty to learn from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/jobs-report/">initial jobs numbers</a>, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the status quo isn&rsquo;t tenable, according to some criminologists, who say cities need to know what is happening elsewhere to understand larger trends that may affect them, such as an increase in gang activity or the effects of a growing demand for drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The necessity to do a one-off, very unrepresentative, unscientific survey to find out the crime rates in major American cities is just appalling,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/ccj/faculty/rosenfeld.html">Richard Rosenfeld</a>, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said in a telephone interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI is working on the problem, Fischer said. The bureau &ldquo;is currently undertaking a wholesale redesign and redevelopment&rdquo; of the UCR program, he said, with one goal being more frequent publication of crime data. Some cities also are reporting data on individual crimes to <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/NIBRS/">the FBI&rsquo;s National Incident-Based Reporting System</a>, but not enough for it to be a comprehensive resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, why can&rsquo;t police departments simply share their monthly data through, say, a Google spreadsheet or an email list? Stephens doubted that could work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even to collect it for the 100 largest cities in America &hellip; is going to require some powerful computing, some quality-control checks and reminders to people that you have to get the data in,&rdquo; he said. The <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/better-data-entry-could-help-stop-rapists-like-darren-sharper-before-they-assault-more-women/">low usage rates</a> for an FBI database that is meant for departments to share data on violent crimes in their jurisdictions shows the challenges of ensuring compliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the FBI could tell us how many crimes of each type were committed in each part of the U.S. in real time, the data would have limitations. Police departments only count crime that has been reported to them. Criminologists often focus on homicide numbers to get around that problem. Murders are the most comparable over time and space: It&rsquo;s easier to define a murder and harder to avoid counting it to suppress crime rates. Yet changes in homicide rates reflect many other factors aside from policing. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116904721076378986">Poverty</a> and <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/">gun availability</a> can also affect homicide rates, yet are mostly outside police departments&rsquo; control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Over the last 40 years, this country has aggressively disinvested in the social safety network and has apparently come to the implicit conclusion that it&rsquo;s a good idea to delegate America&rsquo;s social problems to the criminal-justice system,&rdquo; said Flynn, the Milwaukee chief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also unclear exactly what police departments would do if they had one another&rsquo;s data. Although cities&rsquo; crime rates do <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10940-009-9071-0#page-1">tend to correspond with one another</a>, individual trends can vary greatly. The chiefs association, for instance, asked survey respondents what percentage of homicide suspects or arrestees had prior gun-related arrests. Just 13 departments responded, and their answers ranged from 1 percent to 52 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, the only thing important to cities is what happened in their community, not in other parts of the country,&rdquo; said Jim Bueermann, former police chief in Redlands, California, and now head of <a href="http://www.policefoundation.org/">the Police Foundation</a>, a research organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosenfeld is more of a believer in the usefulness of other cities&rsquo; data. &ldquo;The use is the same as the use for unemployment or heart-disease data nationwide,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You need to know whether your crime problem is purely local and idiosyncratic, for instance produced by an uptick in local gang conflicts, or whether it transcends local boundaries.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;American cities have more in common than they have differences with each other,&rdquo; Flynn said. &ldquo;Mature cities should be able to look at broader trends and patterns of activity, instead of focusing relentlessly on the local angle of a story.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CORRECTION (Sept. 14, 6:50 p.m.): </strong>An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the magnitude of the decline in federal funding for the Byrne Grant Program from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015.

We saw the online marketing industry continue to take shape, further proving that if a company isn&rsquo;t utilizing their social media platforms they definitely should be. All marketers should place high value on social media marketing and any business should consider it an extremely important marketing and advertising tool (that more often than not, is completely free to use).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I&rsquo;m sure you already knew that.

For example, web designer Paul Boag, co-founder of <a href="http://www.headscape.co.uk/">Headscape</a>, makes sure the <a href="http://news.dice.com/2012/06/12/tips-improved-client-relationship-strategy/">first time a client sees a website he&rsquo;s designed</a> it&rsquo;s accompanied with a video of him explaining the design. That way he can communicate his thought process along with his work, thus minimizing confusion when it comes time to review.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Love what you do</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for the infectious nature of enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Luke Filose, NGO Marketing and Engagement Manager, EMPG at <a href="http://intel.com">Intel Corporation</a>. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t appreciate your own work, if you&rsquo;re not passionate about it, why would you expect to make an impression on others and have others recognize you and appreciate you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Do not under-estimate yourself</em>,&rdquo; said Liam Virinovi, self development expert and founder of <a href="http://www.freeinfinitepossibilities.com/">Free Infinite Possibilities</a>. <em>&ldquo;</em>There is an <em>energy</em> with what you do and how you respond. If the energy or attitude you give out is from a <em>position of weakness and doubt</em> (in other words &lsquo;please listen to me I&rsquo;m smart&rsquo;) others will not take you seriously.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Initiate the appreciation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are all monstrously self centered. One of the main reasons you may not feel you&rsquo;re being appreciated is that everyone is spending so much time obsessing over themselves. If you don&rsquo;t feel anyone is appreciating you, ask yourself if you&rsquo;re appreciating others. Start by taking the initiative and recognize others&rsquo; work. Complement in person, via email, and let others know how well you think a colleague is doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Align yourself with rock stars</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Who are the company&rsquo;s rock stars? Can you align yourself with them by getting on their team, or at least commenting/complimenting them on their work? This is a sensitive area because if you go overboard with this process you could quickly be labeled as a &ldquo;kiss ass&rdquo; and your efforts will have backfired. Be genuine about your interest in rock stars&rsquo; work and your desire to work with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be social with key people outside of work</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but coworkers really loosen up and you form stronger bonds with them when you leave the four walls of the office. To form a stronger bond with a coworker, take them out of the office for a low pressure casual lunch. When you take them out, keep work and yourself off the agenda. Spend the time trying to learn more about the person. Keep asking questions to show that you&rsquo;re honestly interested in them. The best compliment you can give a person is to simply show interest. This is your chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Seek acknowledgement outside the company</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes as hard as you try you simply can&rsquo;t get anyone within the company to recognize how awesome you are. In such a situation, most employees start looking for the door. But if you really love your job and you want to keep working at the company, you could seek acknowledgement outside of the organization. If this recognition becomes public, via traditional or social media, it will have a far reaching affect within your organization. It&rsquo;s pathetic, I know, but sometimes the only way to get people within your company to recognize your talent is have someone outside the company point it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may not be so easy if you work for an organization for which all your work is extremely private. Regardless, your thoughts and ideas that are not connected to the company can be recognized. The best way to get recognition is to participate in industry events and especially start volunteering. That&rsquo;s probably the best way you can prove yourself. Not only will the public recognition get back to your company, but they may feel a bit threatened that you might jump ship as others are seeing something in you that they didn&rsquo;t readily see.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When you don&rsquo;t have your own experience, use others&rsquo; experience and quote them</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be awesome, but you also may be green to the industry so it&rsquo;s essentially impossible to show off how much you know and you can do. This is where you have to use the knowledge of others to your advantage. Make sure you&rsquo;re always reading the trade publications and attend as many trade functions you can. Do your best to share the knowledge with your coworkers. The more you do this, that knowledge will be attributed to you and you&rsquo;ll be seen as a valuable resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be patient</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No one is appreciated for their work overnight. You must be patient. If things aren&rsquo;t going your way, never do anything drastic because that will immediately be seen as a sign of desperation and it will most definitely backfire. If you truly are doing great work, communicating that work to others, and making the connections you need to within and outside the organization, then you will see others start to truly appreciate your work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve run the gamut of having my work appreciated and not appreciated. What&rsquo;s your experience?

You may still need to call other numbers, though so all of those numbers have a `9&<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a> added to the front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, LZ77 compression works by finding sequences of data that are repeated. The term &quot;sliding window&quot; is used. All it really means is that at any given point in the data, there is a record of what characters went before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 32K sliding window means that the compressor (and decompressor) have a record of what the last 32768 (32 * 1024) characters were. When the next sequence of characters to be compressed is identical to one that can be found within the sliding window, the sequence of characters is replaced by two numbers-- a distance, representing how far back into the window the sequence starts, and a length, representing the number of characters for which the sequence is identical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a whitepaper, Google collaborators Jyrki Alakuijala, Evgenii Kliuchnikov, and Lode Vandevenne also explain that the Brotli algorithm adds a static dictionary to the compression algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It contains 13,504 words or syllables of English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, and Arabic, as well as common phrases used in machine readable languages, particularly HTML and JavaScript. The total size of the static dictionary is 122,784 bytes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The static dictionary is extended by a mechanism of transforms that slightly change the words in the dictionary. A total of 1,633,984 sequences, although not all of them unique, can be constructed by using the 121 transforms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tests under Linux 3.13.0 on an Intel Xeon Eg-1650 v2 server running at 3.5 GHz, the researchers claimed Brotli running at a 3.381:1 compression ratio could compress at 98.3 MB/s and decompress at 334 MB/s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fastest Deflate could run at a low-quality setting of 2.913:1 compression was 93.5 MB/s compression and 323 MB/s decompression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google notes that better compression would particularly benefit mobile users, who in addition to faster page loads would get savings on their data charges and hopefully lower battery consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to note that Deflate&<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s</a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s</a></a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s</a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;">#39;</a>s</a></a></a> endurance demonstrates just how effective the original work was in 1996 and still is today.

His answer was nothing if not concise: art is everything that you don&rsquo;t have to do. To explain this, Eno pointed out that we need to eat, but we don&rsquo;t need to create a baked alaska. We need to move, but we don&rsquo;t have to do the rumba, or start twerking (unless you need to rapidly generate some hot takes, that is). So anything that isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary &ndash; from forming a football team to cake decoration via installing silicone implants in your chest &ndash; involves a degree of imagination and creativity. And whether rich or poor, we all take part in these artistic activities on a daily basis. Which begs the question why? And what purpose is it serving?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Art </strong><strong>serves a similar purpose to &hellip; a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Boeing </strong><strong>747 simulator</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the sense that we use art to deal with feelings and emotions we might not be able to handle in the real world. With art that disturbs us, we have the ability to turn it off when we want or run away &ndash; we can crash it and there&rsquo;s no real harm done. Eno expanded this idea to cover things that bring us joy, or even just novel experiences. He said he had overheard two women discussing a scene in a soap opera in which one of the characters had just revealed they were a lesbian. He noted that they were discussing it with a much greater freedom and ease than if the central character had been someone they knew in real life. The art was, in effect, acting as a training ground for dealing with such events in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef422f05fcb6f4309226c87bcd79776452e57475/949_300_2462_1478/500.jpg?w=460&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=220678c1496800462ac0eac57beea38c" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Brian Eno calls for rethink about meaning and value of culture</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Eno once tried to change the way Amazon works</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eno claimed during the Q&amp;A segment of his lecture that he once mentioned to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that the company was too insistent on feeding you more of the stuff you&rsquo;ve already consumed: &ldquo;And you think, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, I know enough about medieval chivalry now, please!&rdquo; He suggested that the company invent an algorithm that suggests books based on what a title&rsquo;s previous readers have <em>never</em> ordered. &ldquo;Still not implemented, I might say.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>People &ndash; especially critics &ndash; can put too much emphasis on a song&rsquo;s lyrics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about the role of the critic, Eno said that he valued the opinions of non-artists but thought that critics often displayed flaws. The only one he mentioned was their tendency to focus too much on the words of a song, when the true meaning can be somewhere else entirely. &ldquo;They always think the words are what the important part of a song is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I sort of understand why that is because words are the medium that they work in.

It was a theme he kept returning to: criticising the way governments measure creative output in terms of GDP, discussing the concept of a basic wage for all, and attacking rising inequality. Most pointedly, he praised the many institutions and safety nets &ndash; from the BBC to the dole, libraries to the NHS &ndash; that had helped his own artistic journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Roxy Music had a strict no-drugs policy, and it got broken</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about drugs, Eno said that he doesn&rsquo;t take them these days, partly because they last so long. &ldquo;If someone came out with a really good hallucinogen that lasted about 20 minutes I&rsquo;d probably be hooked on it,&rdquo; he said. He followed this up with an anecdote about how <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/feb/25/roxy-music-10-of-the-best">Roxy Music</a>&rsquo;s no-drugs rule was once broken moments before they were due on stage: &ldquo;A guy walked in, a friend of ours, and he passed round a joint.

It&rsquo;s not ancient Mesopotamian music &ndash; it can&rsquo;t be, because nobody knows what that music sounded like.

With contributions from an international community of scholars, craftspeople and enthusiasts, Andy remade the instrument using authentic techniques and materials, including cedar wood from Afghanistan, bitumen, Gulf pearl shells and lapis lazuli. Once the instrument was completed, artists from all over the world contributed work to the project, but the gold lyre of Ur had never been used to accompany singing, and Andy was looking for someone to sing in Babylonian (one of two variants of the Akkadian language, spoken in Mesopotamia, c2500BC&ndash;AD100).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Andy was looking for someone crazy enough to try singing in Babylonian</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, singing in Babylonian isn&rsquo;t such a crazy idea &ndash; there&rsquo;s a Teach Yourself book about it.

In the late 90s and early noughties we had the perma-smiling Disney kids &ndash; Britney, Christina, Justin &ndash; and shiny, globe-straddling boy bands such as &rsquo;N Sync and Backstreet Boys. Then came the second wave of Disney and TV-based whippersnappers in the shape of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/miley-cyrus-exploited-empowered-debate">Miley Cyrus</a>, Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez. As social media grew and album sales started to dip, a new type of young pop star &ndash; ones that seemed to only exist online but who sold a lot of singles - was born, led by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>. But, regardless of external influences, there&rsquo;s always been one consistent factor that even perfectly preened and media-trained pop practitioners can&rsquo;t avoid; the passing of time. So with all of the above having traversed pop&rsquo;s coming-of-age precipice with varying degrees of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/04/miley-cyrus-vmas-twerking-make-history">subtlety</a> and success, who are pop&rsquo;s future hopes and where are they being created?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How a pop act handles the coming-of-age moment &ndash; that liminal space between innocent teenage star and controversial adult artist &ndash; can often define your future career. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/14/being-britney-the-ups-and-downs-of-a-pop-superstar">Britney&rsquo;s</a> was the toughest ascent into adulthood and involved trying to challenge the public&rsquo;s ingrained perception of her as a forever virgin. Christina, meanwhile, had no such problems given that she broke out of her innocent pop star mould by performing a song called Dirrty on a Saturday morning TV show while wearing leather chaps. When she couldn&rsquo;t sustain that initial shock factor, however, her career stalled. For Justin, the move was easier, with his sexual proclivities &ndash; his nickname was Trousersnake, let&rsquo;s not forget &ndash; celebrated and championed from the start. For Timberlake it was a case of updating his image and moving the music into a more credible framework, ie his first album sounded like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson">Michael Jackson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christina Aguilera: Dirrty music video ft Redman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These initial pop crusaders set the benchmark for those that followed. So, having escaped Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus fell into the Christina framework of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/miley-cyrus-hip-hop-so-what">obliterating her past in a fairly swift</a> and dramatic way, while Justin Bieber mixed a hint of the darkness of Britney&rsquo;s 2007 meltdown with the Timberlake route of trying to sound like Michael Jackson. However, he did it under the increased spotlight of internet thinkpieces, social-media scrutiny <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus">and an angry Sinead O&rsquo;Connor</a>. Nick Jonas, meanwhile, is basically a facsimile of Timberlake circa Justified &ndash; ie he, too, sounds a bit like Michael Jackson &ndash; but with less to lose considering he was never the Jonas that people expected to be a good pop star (that was Joe). Meanwhile, Demi and Selena have both arrived at their Christina moments from slightly different angles. Bored of being her fan&rsquo;s self-help guru via the uplifting ballads Skyscraper and Warrior, Demi&rsquo;s new single <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/demi-lovatos-out-and-out-summer-anthem">Cool for the Summer</a> is a Max Martin-produced bisexuality banger, all whispered coos of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell your mother&rdquo; and outfits that would frighten said parent.

And with a number of other viable establishment options available who seem primed for a stronger general election showing against Hillary Clinton &mdash; from John Kasich to Marco Rubio &mdash; they&rsquo;re seeing fewer and fewer reasons to stick around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-make-or-break-time-for-jeb-bush/2015/09/27/73d5f6fa-63c0-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html?postshare=7821443381559407" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Bush &ldquo;needs to get his favorables up,&rdquo; said a senior GOP bundler who is backing him and requested anonymity to speak candidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People are looking at the stage and saying: &lsquo;Jeb and Marco? I&rsquo;m going with the new,&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; said a top party fundraiser not aligned with a campaign. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re seeing people really gravitate to [Rubio] and saying, &lsquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll buck the Bush machine.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What I hear everywhere when you say Jeb&rsquo;s name is, &lsquo;If you want to lose the general election, nominate Jeb,&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; the fundraiser added.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>No help to Bush is the fact that he is faced with dual problems that require mutually exclusive solutions. In order to keep his donors from flocking to Rubio or Kasich, he needs remain the most viable general election candidate in the Republican field, which he does by (in perfectly circular strategy) continuing to raise astronomical sums of money through both his campaign and super PAC. But in order to keep those donors around, he has to start saying increasingly disqualifying things for the general election, from his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/24/jeb-bush-people-should-chill-out-on-the-anchor-baby-controversy/" target="_blank">embrace</a> of the term &ldquo;anchor baby&rdquo; to his promise to <a href="http://americablog.com/2015/07/jeb-bush-suggests-phasing-out-medicare.html">phase out&nbsp;Medicare</a> to his assertion last week that black voters have flocked to the Democratic Party over the promise of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/charles-m-blow-jeb-bush-free-stuff-and-black-folks.html" target="_blank">free stuff</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8570145056_e9de5258df_z.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Jeb Bush, via Gage Skidmore / Flickr" src="http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8570145056_e9de5258df_z-300x200.jpg" style="height:200px; width:300px" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeb Bush, via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/8570145056" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore / Flickr</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And from the outside looking in as a non-donor, every time Jeb haltingly, uncomfortably lurches to the right it undermines his own case for the presidency. Gone is the&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;who insisted that&nbsp;Republicans like him <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/225681-jeb-bush-lose-the-primary-to-win-the-general" target="_blank">had to be willing to lose the primary</a> in order to win the general, perhaps because he realized&nbsp;that that isn&rsquo;t how&nbsp;how nominating processes work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, you&nbsp;<em>do</em> have to win the primary in order to win the general. And the Republican primary electorate has very little interest in a candidate like Bush &mdash; the son and brother of presidents&nbsp;who patronizes about entitlement culture; the husband of a Latina immigrant who is Very Concerned about anchor babies; the &ldquo;populist&rdquo;&nbsp;who want to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/12/how-jeb-bush-wouldve-saved-3m-with-his-own-tax-plan.html" target="_blank">cut his own taxes</a>; the compassionate conservative who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/06/uselections2000.usa" target="_blank">rigged an election</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the moment Jeb Bush began thinking about putting together a presidential campaign, it&rsquo;s been clear that he has bought in slightly too heavily to the idea that money equals electoral success. While that correlation is there, and it&rsquo;s strong, it&rsquo;s imperfect. If your primary goal is&nbsp;raising as much money as humanly possible, then it isn&rsquo;t winning as many votes as humanly possible. As obvious as that sounds, the concept appears to have been lost on Jeb Bush.</p>\r\n', 'Jeb gets marching orders from donors to start winning or lose their money', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 6, 0),

Plasma 5.4 is a huge update for KDE, bringing everything from preliminary Wayland support to smaller, but more noticeable changes like a nice new set of Plasma Widgets and improvements to K-Runner, the revamped, extendible launcher in Plasma 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KDE team has also been finishing up work on the new flat look of Plasma 5. In our initial review of KDE 5, we said it was a bit rough around the edges, with some missing icons and the fact that the search field in the Kickoff app launcher was hard to discover among a range of issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 5.4, all those elements have been fixed. There are some 1,400 new icons, all consistent with the brighter, flatter design aesthetic the characterises Plasma 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other area that is much improved in this release is KDE&<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;s">#39;s</a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;s">#39;s</a></a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=<a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;s">#39;s</a>"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=#39;s">#39;s</a></a></a> support for HiDPI screens.

You&#39;ve almost certainly used a prefix code when using the phone, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from the dial tone, you press a sequence of what may be five, seven, eight, eleven, twelve, or some other number of keys, and each sequence of keys reaches another specific phone line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now suppose you&#39;re in an office setting with an internal switchboard, as many large companies do. All other phones only require five numbers to dial, instead of seven -- that&#39;s because it&#39;s expected that you&#39;ll be calling those numbers more often. You may still need to call other numbers, though so all of those numbers have a `9&#39; added to the front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, LZ77 compression works by finding sequences of data that are repeated. The term &quot;sliding window&quot; is used. All it really means is that at any given point in the data, there is a record of what characters went before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 32K sliding window means that the compressor (and decompressor) have a record of what the last 32768 (32 * 1024) characters were. When the next sequence of characters to be compressed is identical to one that can be found within the sliding window, the sequence of characters is replaced by two numbers-- a distance, representing how far back into the window the sequence starts, and a length, representing the number of characters for which the sequence is identical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a whitepaper, <a href="searchtags.php?tag=%23Google"><a href="searchtags.php?tag=%23Google">#Google</a></a> collaborators Jyrki Alakuijala, Evgenii Kliuchnikov, and Lode Vandevenne also explain that the Brotli algorithm adds a static dictionary to the compression algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It contains 13,504 words or syllables of English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, and Arabic, as well as common phrases used in machine readable languages, particularly HTML and JavaScript. The total size of the static dictionary is 122,784 bytes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The static dictionary is extended by a mechanism of transforms that slightly change the words in the dictionary. A total of 1,633,984 sequences, although not all of them unique, can be constructed by using the 121 transforms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tests under Linux 3.13.0 on an Intel Xeon Eg-1650 v2 server running at 3.5 GHz, the researchers claimed Brotli running at a 3.381:1 compression ratio could compress at 98.3 MB/s and decompress at 334 MB/s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fastest Deflate could run at a low-quality setting of 2.913:1 compression was 93.5 MB/s compression and 323 MB/s decompression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google notes that better compression would particularly benefit mobile users, who in addition to faster page loads would get savings on their data charges and hopefully lower battery consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to note that Deflate&#39;s endurance demonstrates just how effective the original work was in 1996 and still is today.

Yet the new cricket regime in the country has managed to portray KP as a martyr purely because of their poor handling of the entire episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strauss was thrown into the maelstrom of the KP saga just a week after being appointed to his new role. As he begins about his task of rebuilding English cricket with an objective of winning the 2019 ICC World Cup at home, the ECB director could imbibe a few things by revisiting the well-documented career and philosophy of British football&rsquo;s most successful football manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, Sir Alex Ferguson signed Eric Cantona, quite possibly the greatest acquisition in the history of <a href="searchtags.php?tag=%23Manchester">#Manchester</a> United.

So far, Indian negotiators have publicly staked out an uncompromising position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia embodies a critical tension that will play out in Paris between developed nations like the United States, which are calling for universal emissions cuts, and developing nations like India, which say they deserve to increase fossil fuel use as their economies grow or else receive billions of dollars to transition to cleaner energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Modi met Obama on Monday &mdash; their sixth meeting in 14 months &mdash; he told reporters that the two leaders had &quot;such a deep relationship that we are able to openly discuss all issues,&quot; and said that he was happy to work &quot;shoulder to shoulder with the United States.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut in an earlier speech on Monday, PM Modi said climate change was not India&#39;s fault, and blamed it firmly on &quot;the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;But we in India face its consequences today,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>READ ALSO:<br />\r\n<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Mind-your-carbon-footprints-give-us-space-to-grow-Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-to-rich-nations/articleshow/49989109.cms">Mind your carbon footprints, PM Modi tells rich nations</a></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat India has positioned itself as the champion of developing nations is no great surprise, based on past climate talks.
